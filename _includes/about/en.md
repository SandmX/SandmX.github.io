Hey, I'm Sandm (SandmX, _@sandm_), a young man who knows a little about computer science and art. I call myself a [hacker and painter](https://book.douban.com/subject/6021440/) from the Computer Science Department of RIT (I studied under [Prof. Matthew Fluet](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~mtf/) and specialized in programming languages).

~~Of course, the above is just my bragging~~  People should have their own dreams ~

Currently, my physical activities are mainly in mainland China. I plan to go to Munich in the future (learning German now), and I also want to be a digital nomad. My virtual actor is often seen on Zhihu, Bilibili, Github, etc.

I have my own unique definition of “*ordinary* and *great*”.

I have litte hobbies, just like to type and look at cutting-edge technologies. I learned to draw for a while when I was young and got them easily
